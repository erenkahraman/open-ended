    question:
      "What is the process by which plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using sunlight?",
    correctAnswer:
      "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically using chlorophyll to capture light energy.",

        answer:
          "Photosynthesis is the biological process where plants convert CO2 and H2O into glucose and oxygen using sunlight energy. This process takes place in chloroplasts, where chlorophyll captures light energy to drive the reaction: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2.",

    question:
      "Explain how machine learning algorithms can identify patterns in data.",
    correctAnswer:
      "Machine learning algorithms identify patterns in data by analyzing large datasets, recognizing relationships between variables, and creating mathematical models. They use techniques like clustering, classification, and regression to find hidden patterns and make predictions based on learned relationships.",

        score: 9.5,
        answer:
          "Machine learning algorithms identify patterns by processing large datasets through statistical analysis and iterative learning. They use techniques such as supervised learning for classification and regression, unsupervised learning for clustering, and deep learning for complex pattern recognition. The algorithms adjust their parameters based on feedback to improve accuracy over time.",

    question: "What are the main causes and effects of climate change?",
    correctAnswer:
      "Climate change is primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Effects include rising global temperatures, sea level rise, extreme weather events, ecosystem disruption, and threats to food security.",

        level: "Excellent",
        score: 9.5,
        answer:
          "Climate change is primarily driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial activities. This leads to global temperature rise, causing sea level rise through thermal expansion and ice melt, increased frequency of extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and threats to agriculture and food security.",

        level: "Good",
        score: 7.5,
        answer:
          "Climate change is caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests. This creates greenhouse gases that warm the Earth, causing rising seas, more extreme weather, and problems for plants and animals.",

        level: "Fair",
        score: 5.5,
        answer:
          "Climate change happens because of pollution and cutting trees. It makes the Earth warmer and causes bad weather and flooding.",
